Injuries and niggles are inevitable for people doing regular exercise and playing sport. Injury to the muscles, ligaments and tendons are common and can be caused by sudden impact, inefficient warm up, poor technique and overtraining.
COMMON INJURY TYPES
Strains and sprains are common injuries that affect muscles and ligaments.
Strains happen when a muscle is stretched beyond its limits or is forced to contract too quickly, causing the muscle fibres to stretch or tear. Strains are common in the hamstrings, quadriceps and muscles of the calf.
A sprain occurs when your ligaments have been stretched, twisted or torn, usually as a result of excessive force applied to a joint - especially common in the knee and ankle.
Symptoms of strains and sprains include pain, swelling and inflammation, and loss of movement in the affected body part.
Most minor injuries may be treated with self-care techniques, including RICE therapy and firefly™.
Find out how the firefly™ device aids in the recovery of strains and sprains and reduces swelling after injury. More serious and persistent injuries should be treated by a doctor or physiotherapist.
THE SCIENCE
Read the clinical evidence behind neuromuscular electrostimulation (NMES) and the firefly™ device to increase blood circulation for enhanced sports recovery.
